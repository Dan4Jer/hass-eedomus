# Custom Eedomus Device Mapping Configuration
# This file is for user-customized mappings that override the default mappings.
# It can be edited through the options flow interface in Home Assistant.
#
# To add custom mappings, follow the same structure as device_mapping.yaml
# Example:
#
# custom_rules:
#   - name: "My Custom Device"
#     priority: 1
#     conditions:
#       - usage_id: "123"
#       - name: ".*my device.*"
#     mapping:
#       ha_entity: "light"
#       ha_subtype: "custom"
#       device_class: null
#       icon: "mdi:lightbulb"

# Custom rules for advanced device mapping
# These override the default mapping rules
custom_rules: []

# Custom usage ID mappings
# Override default mappings for specific usage_ids
custom_usage_id_mappings: {}

# Custom name patterns
# Map devices based on name patterns (regex)
custom_name_patterns: []

# Custom dynamic entity properties
# Override which entity types should be dynamic
# Dynamic devices are those whose state can change unpredictably due to user actions
# They are included in opportunistic refresh mechanisms
custom_dynamic_entity_properties: {}
  # Example: Make climate devices dynamic if they have physical controls
  # climate: true

# Custom specific device dynamic overrides
# Override dynamic behavior for individual devices by periph_id
# Use this for devices that don't fit the default entity type behavior
custom_specific_device_dynamic_overrides: {}
  # Example: Make a specific temperature sensor dynamic if it's critical
  # "123456": true
  # Example: Make a motion sensor static if it's in a low-traffic area
  # "789012": false
