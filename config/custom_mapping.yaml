# Custom Eedomus Device Mapping Configuration
# This file is for user-customized mappings that override the default mappings.
# It can be edited through the options flow interface in Home Assistant.
#
# To add custom mappings, follow the same structure as device_mapping.yaml
# Example:
#
# custom_rules:
#   - name: "My Custom Device"
#     priority: 1
#     conditions:
#       - usage_id: "123"
#       - name: ".*my device.*"
#     mapping:
#       ha_entity: "light"
#       ha_subtype: "custom"
#       device_class: null
#       icon: "mdi:lightbulb"
