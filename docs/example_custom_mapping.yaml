# Example custom_mapping.yaml for hass-eedomus
# This file allows you to override default device mappings or add new devices
# that are not covered by the default device_mapping.yaml

# Structure:
# - custom_devices: List of your custom device mappings
#   Each device should have:
#     - eedomus_id: The eedomus device ID (string)
#     - ha_entity: The Home Assistant entity type (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
#     - name: Friendly name for the device
#     - type: (Optional) Additional type information
#     - ha_subtype: (Optional) Subtype for specialized handling (e.g., "rgbw", "brightness", "energy")
#     - icon: (Optional) Material Design icon
#     - room: (Optional) Room assignment

custom_devices:
  # Example 1: Override a default mapping
  # This device exists in device_mapping.yaml but you want to customize it
  - eedomus_id: "12345"
    ha_entity: "light.salon_principal"
    type: "light"
    name: "Lumière Salon (Personnalisé)"
    ha_subtype: "rgbw"  # Important: This tells the system it's an RGBW light
    icon: "mdi:lightbulb-multiple"
    room: "Salon"

  # Example 2: Add a new device not in default mapping
  - eedomus_id: "67890"
    ha_entity: "sensor.temperature_chambre"
    type: "sensor"
    name: "Température Chambre"
    ha_subtype: "temperature"  # Helps with unit conversion and device class
    icon: "mdi:thermometer"
    room: "Chambre"

  # Example 3: RGBW light that should use RGBW color mode
  # Even if it doesn't have 4 child devices, it will use RGBW color mode
  - eedomus_id: "54321"
    ha_entity: "light.spots_cuisine"
    type: "light"
    name: "Spots Cuisine RGBW"
    ha_subtype: "rgbw"  # This ensures RGBW color mode is used
    icon: "mdi:spotlight"
    room: "Cuisine"

  # Example 4: Dimmable light (brightness control)
  - eedomus_id: "98765"
    ha_entity: "light.lampe_bureau"
    type: "light"
    name: "Lampe Bureau"
    ha_subtype: "brightness"  # Enables brightness control
    icon: "mdi:desk-lamp"
    room: "Bureau"

  # Example 5: Color temperature light
  - eedomus_id: "13579"
    ha_entity: "light.plafond_salle_a_manger"
    type: "light"
    name: "Plafond Salle à Manger"
    ha_subtype: "color_temp"  # Enables color temperature control
    icon: "mdi:ceiling-light"
    room: "Salle à Manger"

  # Example 6: Binary sensor (motion, door, etc.)
  - eedomus_id: "24680"
    ha_entity: "binary_sensor.motion_couloir"
    type: "binary_sensor"
    name: "Détection Mouvement Couloir"
    ha_subtype: "motion"  # Helps with device class
    icon: "mdi:motion-sensor"
    room: "Couloir"

  # Example 7: Switch (on/off only)
  - eedomus_id: "11111"
    ha_entity: "switch.prise_cafe"
    type: "switch"
    name: "Prise Machine à Café"
    icon: "mdi:coffee-maker"
    room: "Cuisine"

# Important Notes:
# 1. The ha_subtype field is crucial for proper functionality:
#    - "rgbw": RGBW color control (even if device doesn't have 4 children)
#    - "brightness": Brightness/dimmer control
#    - "color_temp": Color temperature control
#    - "energy": Energy monitoring (for child devices of lights)
#    - "motion": Motion detection (for binary sensors)
#
# 2. If a device is mapped as "rgbw" but doesn't have 4 child devices,
#    it will fall back to a regular light but still use RGBW color mode.
#    This prevents the warning: "set to unsupported color mode onoff"
#
# 3. Icons should use Material Design Icons format: "mdi:icon-name"
#    See https://materialdesignicons.com/ for available icons
#
# 4. Room assignments are optional but help with organization in Home Assistant
#
# 5. To use this file:
#    - Copy it to your Home Assistant config directory as custom_mapping.yaml
#    - Restart Home Assistant or use the eedomus.reload service
#    - Your custom mappings will override any default mappings for the same eedomus_id
